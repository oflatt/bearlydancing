Bearly Dancing To-Do List

pygame
- checking if a surface has width or height 0 before scaling to avoid segfault

bugs
-"l" note was the same note as "a", which cannot be correct

gameplay
- bosses should use concepts from many enemies faced to give a sense of learning and accomplishment
- knomi code name- bear winks at you
- map objects and loading more safely, versioning, safely load with new content
- random star character- one side of leg longer than other so it looks funny
- ddr machine that you can play and dance against
- make jeremy fightable after completion of snow area
- in general, dialogue that reacts to world events- jeremy says something different after steve
- story needs more jokes, more references- nani, you beat my best brother jeremy???!
- different volume envelopes

sound
- talk to characters to modify instrument- add kick, reverb?
- load own sounds using the bowl pianoputer as example
- random generation of wave?
- add noise to one of the synthesizers- "noisey" given to you by a noisy character
- different drums for different enemies, multiple drum samples
  - which wave to start with
  - chance to flip sign with noise
  - variance in how much it changes it with noise
  - less random noise? some sort of wave of noise
  - add noise vs multiply by it
- save to midi, sheet music
- playback mode- have computer replay song perfectly after finishing a battle

battle
- battle code is ugly and convoluted with all the time/health variables

- melodicmode:
	-sync up durations of melodic notes, ones in a line should be shorter
	-better restp function, currently just a 1/9 chance of a rest
- repeatwithvariation more sophisticated- switch notes, offset by a beat. Different types of repeatwithvariation?

rules ideas

- add more score multipliers to notes, scoremultiply function after note has been decided

- triplet mode only for some enemies
- repeating with variation chance to redo all of the rest of the notes? epecially halfway through or power of 2?
- two simple melodies, then both at same time
- left hand repeats while right is a song

- chance while holding a note to start a new note (don't always just add the duration of the note to the current time


Knob ideas for the beatmap generator

- sway pitch to higher or lower for different enemies
- sway probabilities for repeating at different lengths, and the size of these repetitions



graphics
- more life to the game- snow animations
- automatically adjusting resolution, resolution option in settings

Sophie:
-tent snow
-wardrobe open, "why do I have this?"
- update scare square
- better dancing animations (polar giraffe)
- some enemies outlined in black (snake, scare square has potential)
